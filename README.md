# Web-Scrapping
Learned how to scrap data from a website. Here I've taken IMDB website and took the top 250 movies list stored in a excel. Like The Rank, Movie Title, Year of Release and the Rating.


First download all the files.

The prerequisite for this is you need to install 
1. bs4(beautifulsoup)
2. requests
3. openpyxl

The commands to install all the libraries is 
*pip install bs4
*pip install requests
*pip install openpyxl
